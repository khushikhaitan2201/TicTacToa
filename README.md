# TicTacToa
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It features a 3x3 virtual grid, move validation to prevent illegal actions, win and draw detection, and a clean, interactive console-based interface. Players alternate placing their marks (X or O) on the grid, aiming to form a straight line of three symbols.
