This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java that runs entirely in the terminal. It is a simple, interactive console-based game designed for two players. The game provides an engaging way to enjoy the classic Tic Tac Toe experience while practicing or showcasing fundamental Java programming skills.

Features:
1. Two-Player Mode: Both players take turns to play on the same terminal.
2. Dynamic Gameplay: The game updates and displays the board after every move.
3. Input Validation: Ensures players cannot make invalid or duplicate moves.
4. Win/Tie Detection: Automatically determines and announces the winner or a tie at the end of the game.
5. Replay Option: Players can choose to restart the game without re-running the program.

How It Works:
1. The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players are prompted to enter the position (row and column) where they want to place their marker (X or O).
3. The board updates after every move, showing the current game state.
4. The game ends when one player achieves three consecutive markers in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all spots are filled (tie).
5. Players are then given an option to restart or exit.

Prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Basic knowledge of running Java programs through the terminal.
